**STARSORG Application** is an application for a club.

Developed by: **Natalie Meneses**,  **Juan Molina**,  **Jeremy Weisner**

Project Coordinator: **Natalie Meneses**

This application can organize the entire application for a club to have a functional website. I was both the Project Coordinator and Security Manager of the application. Each successful and unsucessful login attempt was audited, with each user having a certain role. Each role granted security clearance into certain screens. Additionally, the application allowed for members to RSVP for events. The membership screen displayed all of the member's information, including a photopath into a profile picture. Certain security privileges allowed one to do several things, such as create events and or even change user's passwords and information. Formatted reports for rsvps, events, members, and roles were also made possible by using the ReportViewer Control.

## Notes

A grand challenge I found as Project Coordinator was making sure every individual was participating in the project. I also had a difficult time with SQL logic and foreign constraints.
